NAudioWrapper
=============

A simple wrapper for NAudio. Comes with some extended functions like looping a song and chaining songs together

Why?
----
I built this small wrapper for a game-esque project, that required not only audio effects, but also music back tracks. This wrapper provides me with these functions by easily being able to start new songs by just providing file system path, but also some more, individual controls, for each sound.
